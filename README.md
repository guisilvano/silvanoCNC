# silvanoCNC

Very early code implementation for a DIY CNC machine. This isn't even doing anything by now.

# Installation

``` shell
~$ git clone https://wwww.github.com/guisilvano/silvanoCNC
~$ make
```

Or:

``` shell
~$ git clone https://wwww.github.com/guisilvano/silvanoCNC
~$ make clean
```

If you don't need the '.o' files.
